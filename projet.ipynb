            "Les modèles de monde pour la conduite autonome actuels, principalement basés sur la diffusion vidéo, sont efficaces pour la génération visuelle mais manquent de flexibilité pour intégrer d'autres modalités comme les actions de conduite. L'intégration transparente de la modélisation du monde et de la planification dans un cadre différentiable reste un défi technique majeur avec les architectures de diffusion.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Objectif :**\n",
            "Lever l'incapacité des modèles de diffusion à gérer des données multimodales de manière flexible en utilisant des transformeurs autorégressifs. L'objectif est d'unifier la simulation du modèle de monde de conduite et la planification de trajectoire en un problème unique de modélisation de séquence, permettant à un seul modèle d'effectuer simultanément la modélisation du monde et la planification de bout en bout.\n",

            "**Méthodologie (DrivingGPT) :**\n",
            "1.  **Langage de Conduite Multimodal :**\n",
            "    *   **Tokenisation des Observations :** Les images de caméra frontale sont converties en tokens discrets à l'aide de VQ-VAE (Variational Quantized AutoEncoder).\n",
            "    *   **Tokenisation des Actions :** Les trajectoires de conduite sont transformées en actions relatives image par image (déplacements longitudinaux, latéraux et rotation de lacet ∆x, ∆y, ∆θ), puis quantifiées en bins discrets.\n",
            "    *   **Séquence Unifiée :** Les tokens d'images et d'actions sont entrelacés (z1, q1, z2, q2, ...) pour former un langage de conduite multimodal.\n",
            "2.  **Architecture du Modèle :** Un transformeur autorégressif de type Llama (appelé DrivingGPT) est utilisé. Il intègre des \"rotary embeddings\" 1D par trame pour les tokens d'image et d'action.\n",
            "3.  **Apprentissage :** Le modèle est entraîné via la prédiction du prochain token (next-token prediction) avec une perte d'entropie croisée standard. Cette approche modélise explicitement la prédiction d'états futurs du monde (pθ(zt|z<t, q<t)) et d'actions futures (planification, pθ(qt|z≤t, q<t)).\n",
            "4.  **Intégration des Actions :** Les actions relatives prédites sont converties en matrices de transformation 2D et multipliées séquentiellement pour obtenir des trajectoires absolues.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Contributions Principales :**\n",
            "*   Proposition d'un nouveau langage de conduite multimodal qui unifie la modélisation visuelle du monde et la planification de trajectoires en une seule tâche de modélisation de séquence.\n",
            "*   Conception de DrivingGPT, le premier modèle à apprendre avec succès et simultanément ces deux tâches via la prédiction du prochain token dans le domaine de la conduite.\n",
            "*   Démonstration de performances robustes par rapport aux méthodes de référence pour la génération vidéo conditionnée par l'action et la planification \"end-to-end\" sur les grands ensembles de données nuPlan et NAVSIM.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Résultats :**\n",
            "*   **Génération Vidéo :**\n",
            "    *   Surpasse les modèles de diffusion (SVD, CogvideoX) en termes de qualité vidéo (FVD et FID) sur le jeu de données navtest.\n",
            "    *   Démontre une capacité supérieure à générer des vidéos longues et cohérentes (jusqu'à 64 images/32 secondes), contrairement aux méthodes de diffusion qui peuvent se répéter ou perdre en qualité.\n",
            "    *   Atténue le phénomène d'hallucination d'objets (apparition ou disparition soudaine).\n",
            "*   **Planification \"End-to-end\" :**\n",
            "    *   Atteint des performances significatives sur le benchmark NAVSIM (en boucle ouverte et sans utiliser le statut ego), surpassant une ligne de base ResNet-50 + MLP et la ligne de base de vitesse constante.\n",
            "    *   Des études d'ablation confirment que DrivingGPT apprend véritablement à conduire plutôt que de simplement copier les actions historiques.\n",
            "    *   La qualité des données d'entraînement est jugée plus importante que la quantité pour la modélisation du langage de conduite.\n",
            "    *   L'application de \"position embeddings\" aux tokens d'action est cruciale pour la performance de planification.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Conclusion et Perspectives :**\n",
            "DrivingGPT démontre la viabilité de l'apprentissage unifié de la modélisation du monde et de la planification avec un seul modèle autorégressif. Cette approche établit une base solide pour de futures explorations de la planification différentiable basée sur des modèles dans la conduite autonome.\n",
